	<h1>Links</h1>
	<p> While <code>href</code> specfies the destination link, <code>target</code> specifies where the linked resource will be opened. If it is not present, then, by default, it will take on the <code>_self</code> value which opens the link in the current tab. To open the link in a new tab or window (depends on browser settings) you can set it to <code>_blank</code>.</p>
	<p>
	<div style="padding-top: 1em; text-align:center">
	    <code>&lt;a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;About The Odin Project&lt;/a&gt;</code>
	</div>
	<p>
	<h2>What does the <code>rel</code> attribute do?</h2>
	<p>Defines the relationship between the current page and the linked document.</p>
	<p><code>noopener</code> value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened. <code>noreferrer</code> value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or &#8220;reference&#8221;) to it. It also includes the <code>noopener</code> behavior and thus can be used by itself as well.</p>
	<p> Doing this prevents phishing attacks where the opened link may change the original webpage to a different one to trick users, something called <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Reverse_Tabnabbing" target="_blank">tabnabbing</a>. Adding the <code>noreferrer</code> can additionally prevent websites from knowing that your webpage links to it.</p>
	<p><strong>Further Note:</strong> More recent versions of browsers provide security if only <code>target="_blank"</code> is present. However it's still a good practice to still pair the blank target with a <code>rel="noopener noreferrer"</code>.
